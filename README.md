You're in the `master` branch, home to the skeleton of what is to become votsec version 1.

For the votsec prototype (version 0), take a look at the [`old-master`](https://github.com/LW2904/votsec/tree/old-master) branch. [`rewrite-frontend`](https://github.com/LW2904/votsec/tree/rewrite-frontent) contains experimentation with an in-house UI solution.
